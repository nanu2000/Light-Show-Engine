# Light-Show-Boilerplate
LightShow is a 3D boilerplate created for my own projects with the purpose of flexibility, scalability, and simplicity. LightShow is meant to be used as a template for creating OpenGL applications. Specifically, games.

Two other projects are used for 3D model exporting and font atlas file creation. Both are currently private.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Required:
A linux or windows system that supports OpenGL 3.3+

### Windows 10 install for Visual Studio Cross Platform with Linux
* Git clone --recursive
* open root dir in Visual Studio
* Supply CMake settings
* install https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html - both 86 and 64. These are used to build Google protobuf
* navigate to /lib/protobuf_build
* run populate_all.bat and supply your version of VsDevCmd.bat as an arg. 

ex:
```populate_all.bat "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Preview\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"```

Protobuf should then be installed in C:\sdk\protobuf
This WILL take a while. 

* navigate to /lib/gamenetworksockets_build
* run populate_all.bat and supply your version of VsDevCmd.bat as an arg. 

ex: 
```populate_all.bat "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Preview\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"```

GameNetworkSockets should then be installed in /lib/gamenetworksockets_build This shouldn't take as long as it took protobuf to build.

* Create a vm for linux. I used Ubuntu 16.04. This could also be a real machine you can ssh into.
* Configure ssh login for linux machine (not going to go into this, plenty of tutorials)
* Add machine ssh credentials to cmakesettings
* in launch.vs.json, your pipeArgs should look something like this:
```
"pipeArgs": [
          "/s",
          "${debugInfo.remoteMachineId}",
          "/p",
          "${debugInfo.parentProcessId}",
          "/c",
          "export DISPLAY=:0;${debuggerCommand}",
          "--tty=${debugInfo.tty}"
],
```
The export DISPLAY=:0; is a MUST or else you will get a segfault. Additionally, if you are using a linux VM you may have to prepend
```export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3;``` to your pipeArgs after ```export DISPLAY=:0;```.

Verify the configuration name in your launch.vs.json file matches your cmake executable name.

#### Configure linux machine for development
Install SDL2:
``` 
apt install libsdl2-dev  
apt install libsdl2-mixer-dev
apt install libsdl2-image-dev
```
Install libssl:
```
apt install libssl-dev
```
You will most likely need to update libssl because apt-get wont do the job. This awesome q/a will show you how to update libssl from it's source: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1102803/how-to-upgrade-openssl-1-1-0-to-1-1-1-in-ubuntu-18-04

Install protobuf:
```
apt install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```
Install cmake:
```
apt install cmake
```
Install ninja:
```
apt install ninja-build
```
Install gamenetworkingsockets:
```
git clone 
cd GameNetworkingSockets
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja
```

Optional but I move the output files into lib
```
cd src
mv libGameNetworkingSockets_s.a /usr/lib
mv libGameNetworkingSockets.so /usr/lib
```

#### With that, you should have a dev environment running on Microsoft Visual Studio capable of compiling and debugging for Windows, and Linux. 

### Building on Linux (standalone)
I haven't tested building only on linux, however it should be easier to setup. Install everything mentioned [above](#configure-linux-machine-for-development)
then run:
* git clone --recursive
* run cmake
* run make

You will need to provide certain variables in the CMake config to make this work.

## Debugging Build System
* Double check CMakeSettings like SDL2_DIR and GNS_LIB_DIR, they should both point to their library directories.
* In Windows, the populate_all scripts need to be supplied with VsDevCmd.bat. The path for VsDevCmd.bat differs on each version of visual studio.
